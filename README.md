# Model Explorer

Model Explorer is a Kotlin project that scans specified packages and generates PlantUML diagrams from the model classes. It then stores the generated diagrams in the database.

Model Explorer can also compare the stored PlantUML diagrams against the current ones and generate new database records if they are different.
